# collect_my_data

I want to collect data about myself because it's been a project I've always wanted to do but never got around to doing it. Most trackers like Habitica often fall out of use and I couldn't think of a decent way to track what I'm doing until now. I know I can open up google sheets and fill in the oclumns myself but I want to lower the barrier to data logging. So I'll write an ios app to put on my phone and tablet


I can sort everything into multiple tabs:


Automated
 - number of hours watched on youtube
 - humber of videos watched on youtube
 - when did I turn down my music volume after I blasted it for a while (this happens when I usually need to really focus on something. The blast gets me in the mood I guess)

----
If I'm ever rich enough to afford a pebble here are the following biometrics I want to keep track of
 - Heartrate
 - steps walked

Schedule-based / Actions-based
 - When did my parents finish making dinner
 - number of hours of TV shows/ Films (tbh only Silicon Valley)
 - If I went out with friends
 - Number of hours I spend working
 - Time I've spent talking to friends
 - When did I start dressing for work
 - When did I stop dressing for work
 - When did I go on a nap and how long was it?

Spontaneous - please please include a comments column
 - My current energy levels (how pumped I am to work)
	- How pumped I am to spill out ideas rn
 - My current mood
 - My heartrate


End of Day / Morning
 - number of hours of sleep I got last night (Morning)
 - How I am feeling at the end of the day
	 - Mood (rating from 1-10)
	 - Energy level (rating from 1-10)
 - How I am feeling at the end of the day
	 - Mood (rating from 1-10)
	 - Energy level (rating from 1-10)





My goal is to form a sort of schedule of my daily habits and track if I'm actually following the calendar I set for myself.

A SOLID PROTOTYPE OF THIS WILL BE OUT ON APRIL 20TH. (Sorry Kaggle and ml in cpp. dw I have decent plans for you two :) )


I guess a part of why I'm doing this is to help myself refocus. This is a terrible analogy but I think of this as Ghenghis Khan's 3-month mongol hunt to bring his two brothers close together. Refocusing on his goals. Brilliant.
